Our company values are as follows:

* We are dedicated to building an API platform that meets your needs.
* We will provide you full control over your data and firmly believe it is your right to backup, export and delete ALL of your data whenever you want.
* We provide you with no less than what we would expect from services we use in both business and personal matters.
* We strive to earn your trust by being forthright with you. We will, at times, face difficult decisions and occasionally make mistakes, but we will be open with you and  conscientiously attend to any issues that may arise.

Our continued existence and ability to contribute relies on building a financially successful API platform. The API platform is our team's main source of financial renumeration. We will therefore be putting 100% of our effort into it.

We are but one service in a large ecosystem of services. That being true, we aim to contribute to this environment in a positive way. Our API platform was built by developers for developers. This means that our team members have a track record enriching this community.
