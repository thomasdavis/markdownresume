APIENGINE.IO is committed to providing an outstanding experience. As part of this commitment, we offer
standard level technical support to all APIENGINE.IO account holders. Standard technical support is limited to 
the scope, hours, contacts, and channels covered below.

A. Scope

* General questions about APIs

And for troubleshooting:

* Providing workarounds or resolutions for known problems

While APIENGINE.IO does not offer a direct paid consulting or professional services program, we are very
interested in the whole API marketplace and its evolution.  We are more than happy to refer any requests.

also be submitted by sending email from a registered APIENGINE.IO account email address to support@apiengine.io.

D. Unsupported Channels

F. Proactive Monitoring
-----------------------

The APIENGINE.IO service is monitored 24x7 by automated systems. In the event of any issue affecting the health

diagnose and correct any issues. This 24/7 monitoring covers the entire APIENGINE.IO platform, benefitting all 
APIENGINE.IO users.

In the event of a service issue, a notice will be posted on our APIENGINE.IO status site at status.apiengine.io 
to communicate out of band the impact and status of our primary service. In the case of an ongoing service
issue, you do not need to submit a support ticket. Instead, monitor the status page which will contain
